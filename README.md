An application to see how much I spend on coffee

To use this application clone it and run docker-compose up in the root directory of the project.
After docker-compose has completed (the last output line should contain CRIT Server 'unix_http_server' running without any HTTP authentication checking)
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 and login with username 'admin@admin.com' and password 'admin'

The application code is in laravel/src
